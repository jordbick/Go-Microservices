Go Kit is a bundle of different libraries used to build microservices
The libraries provide components for logging, metrics, tracing, rate limiting and circuit breaking etc.

3 Major components in a Go Kit based app:
- Transport layer = Ways your microservices can communicate with one another and the outside world
- Endpoint layer = Microservice functions that get exposed. Each endpoint represents a single RPC method
- Service layer = Business logic of the microservice
